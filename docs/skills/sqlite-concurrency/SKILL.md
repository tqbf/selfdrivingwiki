description: This app's SQLite concurrency discipline — the store is method-atomic (internal recursive lock + savepoint transactions); writes flow through the main-actor model, off-main reads go through WikiReadPool, and connection state must never cross a call boundary. Read before adding anything that touches the store off the main actor or composes transactions.

# SQLite concurrency: method-atomic store, pooled readers

`SQLiteWikiStore` keeps **one connection** with a **prepared-statement cache
keyed by SQL text**. Since graph-model Phase 0
(`plans/graph-model-and-versioning.md` §8) the store is **method-atomic**: every
public entry point holds an internal `NSRecursiveLock` for its whole body, and
transactions nest via `withTransaction` (outermost `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, inner
`SAVEPOINT`s). That changed the rules. This skill is the current discipline.

> **Invariant:** the store is safe to *call* from any thread — but UI writes
> still flow through the `@MainActor` model (they mutate observable state), and
> off-main reads go through **`WikiReadPool`** (separate read-only snapshot
> connections), not the write store. No statement handle, column pointer, or
> other connection state ever crosses a method boundary.

## What changed and what stayed

| | Before Phase 0 | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Thread safety | Conventional ("main actor only") | Structural (recursive lock around every method body) |
| Off-main reads | Forbidden | Via `WikiReadPool` (preferred) or the store itself (safe, but contends with the writer) |
| Off-main writes | Forbidden | *Safe* but still **routed through the main-actor model** — observable state (`summaries`, `sources`, drafts) must mutate on main |
| Transactions | Six raw `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` sites, non-nestable | `withTransaction` (savepoint nesting); transaction-owning methods compose |
| `renameSource` | "Eventually consistent" multi-statement | Atomic (one transaction; embedding/FTS side effects after commit) |
| Bulk work | Blocking modal, sole owner of the store | Blocking modal still the default shape; off-main bulk is possible but needs a model-coordination design first (open question §13.4 of the plan) |

## Why the lock, not just `FULLMUTEX` (the failure that started this)

The connection is opened `SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX`, which serializes *individual*
C calls. That never protected the app-level sequence: the statement cache hands
two callers of byte-identical SQL the **same `sqlite3_stmt*`**, and

```
Thread A: sqlite3_column_text(stmt)  → pointer P into stmt's row buffer
Thread B: sqlite3_step(stmt)/reset   → stmt advances/clears, P now garbage
Thread A: String(cString: P)         → traps on invalid UTF-8 (EXC_BREAKPOINT)
```

This crashed launch twice (a clean `exit()` from MLX off-main, and the
`String(cString:)` trap from a detached-Task store read). The method-atomic
lock makes the whole bind → step → read sequence indivisible; the regression
guard is `StoreConcurrencyTests.concurrentReadersAndWriterDoNotCorrupt`.

## The rules

### 1. Reads that shouldn't block typing → `WikiReadPool`

```swift
// WikiStoreModel — debounced search (the pattern to copy)
if let pool = self.readPool {
    results = (try? await pool.asyncRead { reader in
        try reader.searchSimilar(query: query, limit: 20)
    }) ?? []
} else {
    results = (try? self.store.searchSimilar(query: query, limit: 20)) ?? []
}
```

- Pool connections are `SQLiteWikiStore(readOnlyURL:)`: `query_only=ON`, **no
  migrations, no open-time self-heal** — a pool member can never author schema
  or write. (Never build a pool from `init(databaseURL:)` — that init *writes*
  on open: migrations + search self-heal.)
- Each pooled store has its own statement cache → no aliasing with the writer.
- WAL = N readers + 1 writer across connections *and* processes; this is the
  same mechanism `wikictl` and the File Provider extension already rely on.
- The pool is `nil` for in-memory wikis and in most tests — **always keep the
  main-store fallback branch.**

### 2. Writes stay on the main-actor model

Not because SQLite would corrupt (it won't anymore) but because every write is
followed by observable-state mutation (`reloadSummaries()`, `sources`, tab
retitling) that must happen on main, and the synchronous write-then-reload
contract is load-bearing across ~100 call sites. Don't move writes off-main
piecemeal; that redesign is plan §13.4.

### 3. Compose multi-step writes with `withTransaction`

```swift
try store.withTransaction {
    // any store calls — including methods that own their own transactions
    // (replaceLinks, storePageChunks): they become SAVEPOINTs inside this.
    try store.updatePage(...)
    try store.replaceLinks(...)
}
```

- Outermost call = `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (grab the write lock up front, the
  long-standing discipline). Nested = savepoints; an inner failure rolls back
  only itself, so `try?`-best-effort side effects keep their semantics.
- Never write raw `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` in store code again.
- **Never run model inference or network I/O inside `withTransaction`** — an
  open write transaction stalls `wikictl` (the second writer process).
  `renameSource` shows the shape: transaction commits first, then best-effort
  `reembedSource`/`upsertSourceSearch`.

### 4. Adding a store method? Take the lock.

Every public/internal entry that touches `db`, `statements`, or
`transactionDepth` starts with:

```swift
lock.lock(); defer { lock.unlock() }
```

Private helpers called only from locked entries don't re-take it (the lock is
recursive, so re-taking is harmless — but the convention is: lock at the public
boundary). A method returning a single expression needs an explicit `return`
after the lock line.

### 5. Values only across boundaries

Reads return decoded Swift structs (`WikiPage`, `SourceSummary`, …). Never let
a `SQLiteStatement`, a raw handle, or a column pointer escape a method — the
lock protects a method body, not your saved pointer. `SQLiteStatement.text(at:)`
already copies bytes out immediately with a lossy-UTF-8 fallback; keep using it
(❌ `String(cString:)` — traps on invalid UTF-8, stops at embedded NUL).

### 6. Bulk work: blocking modal is still the default shape

The one-time search-index upgrade (`WikiStoreModel.upgradeSearchIndex`) keeps
its non-dismissible sheet: main-actor store I/O, off-main **pure compute**
(MLX embedding) only. With the method-atomic store this is now a UX choice
rather than a crash-safety requirement — but do not convert it to a background
job without designing model coordination (who reloads observable state, when)
— plan §13.4.

## Anti-patterns (updated)

- **Pooling `init(databaseURL:)` connections** — that init writes (migrations,
  self-heal). Read-only pools use `init(readOnlyURL:)`, always.
- **Holding a write transaction across embedding/network** — stalls `wikictl`.
- **Raw `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` in store code** — breaks nesting; use `withTransaction`.
- **Off-main writes that then mutate observable state from that thread** —
  route writes through the model on main.
- **Letting a statement or column pointer outlive its method** — the lock can't
  protect it.
- **`String(cString:)` on a DB column** — byte-length lossy decode only.
- **Treating `SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX` as app-level safety** — it serializes C
  calls, not bind/step/read sequences; the recursive lock does that.

## Verifying

```sh
# New store methods must take the lock at entry:
grep -n "public func\|internal func" Sources/WikiFSCore/SQLiteWikiStore.swift | wc -l
grep -c "lock.lock(); defer { lock.unlock() }" Sources/WikiFSCore/SQLiteWikiStore.swift
# No raw transactions outside withTransaction:
grep -n "BEGIN IMMEDIATE\|ROLLBACK" Sources/WikiFSCore/SQLiteWikiStore.swift   # only inside withTransaction
# The regression suite:
swift test --filter StoreConcurrencyTests
```
